# Agent Reference

- **issue_cylinder.md** is the authoritative implementation reference for Security Deposit / Issue Cylinder and Cylinder Return / Refund Deposit workflows.
- Read `issue_cylinder.md` before changing POS custody, security-deposit, cylinder-return, return-gas, or related stock/ledger behavior.
- Preserve atomic posting, physical cylinder identity, customer custody history, separate deposit balance, and server-side validation.
- Update relevant documentation/test cases when changing these workflows.
- **Branch safety:** work on the task's designated feature branch. Do not commit task changes to `main), do not merge automatically, and do not change unrelated feature branches. Merge only after explicit owner approval.
- The current mobile/multi-shop requirements branch is `feature/mobile-multishop-ordering-requirements`. Start with `docs/mobile-multishop/README.md) and complete the documented gap analysis before implementing schema or application code.

## Work in Progress — Pricing (branch `feature/pricing-rate-resolver`)

- **Resume point:** `testcase.md` → "Progress". It lists the cases passed on the current code, the next case to run, and the open work.
- Rules and design: `requirements.md` → Rate Configuration and `CLAUDE.md` → Pricing / Browser tests.
- Changes are uncommitted. Do not commit, push or open a PR without the owner's approval.
- Test the way the owner asked: headed Chrome, in parallel where possible, with the wave runner `npm run test:pricing:waves` (plan: `tests/e2e/pricing.plan.json`). Waves run in order and stop at the first failing wave. Record the results in `testcase.md`.
- For every new or changed requirement, update `requirements.md` and the other relevant docs without asking.
## Mobile / Multi-Shop Ordering Rules — MUST FOLLOW

- One Flutter app supports Android and iOS, with Customer and Shop Staff/Owner experiences.
- One business can own multiple shops (`locations`). Each customer belongs to exactly one shop; a shop can have many customers.
- A customer can place orders only for their assigned shop. One order belongs to one business, one shop and one customer; split orders across shops are out of MVP scope.
- A business owner can access only shops and records belonging to their business. Shop managers/order staff can access only explicitly assigned shop(s).
- Preserve the existing `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, and `PermissionService` system. Extend it with capabilities and explicit business/shop scope; do not introduce a parallel permission engine or trust role names alone.
- Current schema gap to address through reviewed, backward-compatible migrations: `locations) has no business parent and `customers) has no `location_id). Never guess legacy customer ownership or silently move historic ledger/financial records.
- Mobile API requests must not depend on browser session state and must never connect directly to MySQL. Use versioned HTTPS JSON endpoints with token/session authentication.
- An order is not a sale. Pending/accepted orders must not post revenue, payments, cash movements, customer OS, security deposits, cylinder custody or inventory movements.
- Revalidate shop/customer ownership, permissions, prices, product eligibility and stock at acceptance/fulfilment. Prevent duplicate order submissions and duplicate order-to-sale posting.
- Reuse existing validated application services for actual POS posting; do not duplicate financial or inventory rules in Flutter.
- Read all requirements in `docs/mobile-multishop/` before changing implementation. Update requirements/status as decisions are made. Record unresolved product decisions rather than inventing behavior.
- Run relevant automated tests, current-commit runtime QA for affected screens, and existing POS/security/ledger regression tests. Never claim a test passed without execution evidence.

## Transaction-Type Isolation Rule — MUST FOLLOW

- Each POS transaction type has its **own UI layout, rendering logic, validation flow, and business-flow boundary**.
- A change requested for one transaction type MUST NOT alter, break, hide, resize, or change the business behavior of another transaction type.
- Do not share transaction-specific DOM/CSS selectors, calculations, validation, or payment behavior unless the shared component is explicitly designed to be type-neutral.
- When modifying one transaction type, regression-test **all four POS transaction types**: Gas Sale / Refill, Cylinder Sale, Security Deposit / Issue Cylinder, and Cylinder Return / Refund Deposit.
- Keep transaction-specific containers and mode classes isolated so changes remain scoped to the selected transaction type.
- Any intentional cross-type change must be explicitly documented in `issue_cylinder.md` and regression-tested.

## POS Layout Rule

- Preserve a responsive, non-overflowing layout for every transaction type.
- Never introduce a fixed table width, hidden column, or global CSS rule that reserves space for fields not displayed for the current transaction type.

## Runtime QA Rule — MUST FOLLOW

- Whenever a fix, feature, layout change, JavaScript change, backend change, or other modification is made to any screen, automatically identify **all impacted screens and workflows** and execute the **LPG Runtime QA** workflow for those screens.
- The user does **not** need to explicitly ask for QA. Running the appropriate runtime QA is mandatory after every screen-level change.
- Runtime QA must exercise the actual affected screen through the browser, including relevant controls, navigation, interactions, validation, and impacted business flows—not only static syntax or code checks.
- If Runtime QA finds any failure, JavaScript error, UI issue, broken interaction, regression, or unexpected behavior, fix it and run the impacted Runtime QA again.
- Continue the fix → runtime QA → fix cycle until the impacted screen/workflow works correctly and the relevant Runtime QA passes.
- For changes affecting multiple screens, run QA coverage for **each impacted screen**, plus regression coverage for directly related workflows.
- Do not report a screen-level fix as complete until the corresponding impacted-screen Runtime QA has passed.
- Never rely on a previous QA result from an older commit when the current change could affect the tested screen; QA must validate the current commit.
