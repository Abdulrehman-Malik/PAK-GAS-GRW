# Perfect LPG — Database Migration Deployment Order

All manual SQL migrations in this directory use the format:

```
NNN_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
```

The **NNN** prefix is the deployment sequence. The date remains in the filename so the feature/change date is still visible.

## Deployment rules

The application now checks this directory on the login page. A pending migration is shown there with an **Execute Pending Migrations** button. Migrations are executed strictly by numeric sequence, one at a time. If one migration fails, execution stops immediately and later migrations remain pending.

Execution results are recorded in `lpg_migration_history`, including status, checksum, start/end time, duration, executed statement count, and the error message for failures. Login is blocked until every migration is successfully applied. An already-applied migration file may not be changed; create a new sequence instead.


1. Run `database/schema.sql` only for a fresh database.
2. For an existing database, run only the migration scripts that have not already been applied.
3. Always execute pending migrations in ascending sequence order: **001 → 002 → ... → 029 → 030 → 031 → 032 → 033 → 034 → 035 → 036 → 037**.
4. Migration **011** is not a normal upgrade migration. It is a controlled, destructive refresh intended for disposable staging/test databases. It clears transactional records plus customers, suppliers, cylinder types, rate cards, and rate-change history. Users, roles, permissions, locations, shop settings, cash registers, inventory policies, and other application configuration remain. Whenever a later migration introduces a new transactional table, update the controlled refresh service/script so that table is reset too.
5. Do not automatically run migration 011 during production deployment.
6. A fresh install loads the current `schema.sql` and then runs the migrations. Any migration that changes something a later migration redefines needs an "already applied" check in `MigrationRunnerService::migrationAlreadyApplied()`, so it is skipped on a fresh install. Example: 032 narrows `rate_cards.rate_type`, which 035 later changes. Without such a check, an old migration re-runs on the new schema and fails or undoes newer changes. Its check must also accept the newer state. Never edit an applied migration file to fix this: the runner blocks login when an applied file's checksum changes.
7. The checksum comparison ignores line endings (LF or CRLF), because git with `core.autocrlf` may write the same migration either way. Any other change to an applied migration still blocks login.
6. Do not rename or reorder an already released migration. Add a new sequence number for every future migration.
7. Keep migration files idempotent where practical so a partially completed deployment can be safely retried.

## Fresh database

The current `database/schema.sql` already contains the current application schema. For a fresh database, use the schema first and apply only migrations needed for compatibility/testing of an existing-installation path.

## Existing database

Before deployment, identify the latest sequence already applied and continue from the next pending sequence. The numeric prefix is the authoritative execution order; the date is informational.

## Staging refresh

To intentionally reset transactional/test data, parties (customers and suppliers), cylinder types, and LPG rates/rate history:

```sql
USE perfect_lpg;
SET @lpg_refresh_transactional_data = 1;
SOURCE database/migrations/011_20261003_refresh_transactional_data.sql;
```

After the refresh, re-create customers/suppliers, cylinder types, and rates before resuming normal POS and inventory operations. Never execute the staging refresh against production unless a deliberate full reset of these records is explicitly intended.

## Future migration naming standard

Use:

```
012_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
014_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
015_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
```

Never reuse an existing sequence number.

- `014_20261004_pos_source_filled_cylinder_selection.sql` — adds the branch-level POS setting controlling manual source filled-cylinder selection versus automatic sequential allocation.
- `019_20261005_stock_adjustment_history.sql` — adds dedicated stock-adjustment transaction headers, references, reasons, and before/after snapshots.


## Credit Sale / OS Rules

- A credit sale exists when a sale is not fully paid and therefore increases customer OS.
- Existing customer OS is included when validating a new credit sale.
- Customer Allow Credit Sale is stored in customers.allow_credit_sale and defaults to OFF.
- credit_limit_validation_mode values are none, customer, and shop.
- none means no credit-limit restriction; customer validates the selected customer's projected OS; shop validates projected positive OS across the branch and ignores individual customer credit limits.
- Shop-level validation uses a branch-wide database lock to prevent concurrent credit sales from collectively exceeding the shop limit.
- These rules are enforced server-side; POS display/JavaScript is only an early user-feedback layer.

- `031_20261009_default_gas_entry_mode.sql` — adds the branch-level default Gas Entry option (KG, Amount, or Cylinders) for Gas Sale / Refill.
- `032_20261019_client_feedback_plants_wholesale_refill.sql` — supplier plants, purchase plant, refill-empty purchase line, filled-cylinder purchase origin, customer retail/wholesale type and wholesale per-cylinder rate.
- `033_20261021_performance_indexes.sql` — index-only performance migration for sales, receipts, cash, purchases, supplier payments and expenses lookups (no behaviour change).
- `034_20261021_pricing_settings.sql` — shop-level Pricing settings (Wholesale price list on/off, Default Rate, Walk-in price list, Customer special rates on/off, POS rate-change control, invoice price-list switch); customers can follow the shop default price list; sales store the price list and rate-change reason, and sale lines store the rate source.
- `035_20261021_rate_price_lists.sql` — adds `price_list` (retail / wholesale) to `rate_cards` and `rate_change_log`. It converts the old `wholesale_cylinder` rates to Wholesale `gas_per_cylinder` and `cylinder_package` to Retail `empty_cylinder`. It then narrows `rate_type` to `gas_per_kg` / `gas_per_cylinder` / `empty_cylinder`, re-adds the rate-type CHECK and adds the `idx_rate_price_lookup` index. It is idempotent (26 statements).
- `036_20261021_customer_special_rates.sql` — creates `customer_rates`: a customer's own Gas per KG / Gas per full cylinder / Empty cylinder price per shop, dated, stoppable, with value and rate-type CHECKs. It adds `customer_id` and `customer_rate_id` to `rate_change_log` and makes its `price_list` optional. It is idempotent (6 statements).
